Strichliste
===========

[![Managed with Taiga](https://taiga.io/media/support/attachments/article-22/banner-gh.png)](https://tree.taiga.io/project/don42-strichliste-python/ "Managed with Taiga")

This project is a API compatible reimplementation of [Strichliste](https://github.com/hackerspace-bootstrap/strichliste)
It is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and is rewritten every two weeks.
The next step is probably to port it to Django. Afterwards the js frontend needs to be upgraded to use integers/cents.
